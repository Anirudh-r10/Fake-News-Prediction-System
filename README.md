The project encompasses a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed for fake news detection. The system involves meticulous data preprocessing to enhance the quality of textual data, followed by training three distinct models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. These models exhibit robustness in learning patterns and relationships within real and fake news articles. The project also includes a manual testing function, allowing users to dynamically assess news articles' authenticity using the trained models. The implementation demonstrates high accuracy and reliability, offering a versatile and practical tool for combating misinformation. This GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding, implementing, and deploying effective solutions for fake news detection in various applications.
